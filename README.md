## Give a Star! :star:
If you like or find this project useful for learning, please consider giving it a star. Thanks!

## Introduction
- This is based on the pluralsight course [Intro to Prism 7 for WPF](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/prism-wpf-introduction/table-of-contents)


## Pre Reqs
- Visual STudio 2022, V17.4.0 or above. This update is necessary because this installs .net 7. And the examples here are with .net 7 and not .net 6.
- [Prism Template Pack extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrianLagunas.PrismTemplatePack).
